# Data Archival
---

{NOTE: }

* As a database grows, basic functions like indexing can slow down.  
  To address this, RavenDB offers the ability to **archive selected documents**.  
 
* Documents that are rarely accessed or no longer relevant for active use,  
  but still need to be kept for compliance or historical purposes, can be archived.

* This feature is covered in detail in the following articles:
  * [Data archival overview](../../../data-archival/overview)
  * [Enable data archiving](../../../data-archival/enable-data-archiving)
  * [Schedule document archiving](../../../data-archival/schedule-document-archiving)
  * [Archived documents and other features](../../../data-archival/archived-documents-and-other-features)
  * [Unarchiving documents](../../../data-archival/unarchiving-documents)
