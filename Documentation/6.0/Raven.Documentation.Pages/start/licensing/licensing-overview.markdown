### Developer

* The developer license is for development use only and isn't applicable for commercial use.  
  You must upgrade this license before going into production.   
* It is fully featured but temporary - license lasts 6 months and can be renewed.  
* Certificates exceeding 4 months expiration period are Not allowed to be used with this license.  
  Automatic renewal of Let’s Encrypt certificates is disabled.  
* When you are ready to go into production:  
   * Be sure to choose a license that has all features with which your client was developed.  
   * [Upgrade to a production license](https://ravendb.net/buy) and then [replace](../../start/licensing/replace-license) the developer license.  
* The developer license can be obtained [here](https://ravendb.net/buy#developer).

---

### Community

* A basic production-grade license.
* Community licenses last one year and can be renewed every year.  
* Servers using a Community license are **required to run the latest major version**.  
  E.g., if RavenDB `7.0` is released and your server runs RavenDB `6.2` with a Community license, 
  you will be required to upgrade RavenDB to version `7.0`.  
  Running RavenDB of an older version than the latest with a Community license will **block your 
  server's access to Studio**.  
  {NOTE: Grace Period}
  If you run your server with a Community license and a new RavenDB major version is released, 
  Studio will continue to function for **14 days** before it is blocked.  
  During this period, a pop-up notification will show when Studio is started:  
  ![Grace period](images/grace-period.png "Grace period")
  You can: 
  
   * **Close the notification and keep on working**  
     For 14 days, after which Studio will be blocked until the server is upgraded or the license replaced.  
   * **Replace your license**  
     Acquire a non community license that allows you to use an older version.  
   * **Download a new server version**  
     Upgrade to the latest major version.
